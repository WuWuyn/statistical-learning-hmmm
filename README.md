# Statistical Learning Solution 
This GitHub repository contains my solutions to the exercises, including both conceptual and applied parts, from the book Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python by Gareth M. James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jonathan Taylor. 

These solutions are intended solely for learning purposes and should not be used for any other purpose. 

Please note that the solutions may contain some inaccuracies.
## Regarding the book and related materials
The book and its materials, including slides and datasets, are owned by the website https://www.statlearning.com/ and can be accessed for free. 
Additionally, there are YouTube lectures on Statistical Learning with Python that explain the book's content and provide guidance for practicing the Lab exercises.

## Repository Structure
This repository includes:
- **ISLP_Excercises folder:** Contains solutions to the exercises at the end of each chapter (divided into two files: one for conceptual exercises and one for applied exercises).
- **ISLP_book folder:** Contains the book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python*. This book is sourced from the website https://www.statlearning.com/.
- **ISLP_csv_files and ISLP_slides folders:** Contain dataset files, stored in this manner to facilitate working on exercises, and slides for quick review of content during exercises. These datasets and slides are available at https://www.statlearning.com/resources-python.

Additional Note: All resources are available on the official website. It is recommended to download the content from the website to ensure you have the latest updates.
